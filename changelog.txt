V0.3b Build 2020.10.06
Introducing NCURSES build of ledacs-esk as a new seperate program
 ledacs-esk-ncurses is a drop in replacement for ledacs-esk, call with same parameters
  or use nstart.sh file included; modify at your leisure
 users will need to install libncurses5-dev and libncurses5 to use ledacs-esk-ncurses
 ledacs-esk and ledacs-esk-analyzer are still available

Changed AFC nomenclature to OFF to represent Hz off from center frequency (PPM)
Updated readme.txt to reflect usage of ledacs-esk-ncurses
Cleaned up readme.txt in regards to AFC vs OFF and fixed/clarified AFC OFF meaning
Included ledacs-esk-ncurses into build, rebuild, and pi-build script files

Site ID now prints as decimal and hex side by side (my personal preference)
Nice ascii art added to ledacs-esk-ncurses

V0.28 Build 2020.09.08
Had to Fix LCN again, was grabbing 6 bits instead of 5;
 Would have potentially caused issues with that extra bit grab on higher LCN numbers

V0.27 Build 2020.09.07
Implemented Channel Assignment Types for: 
   MT-1:
   00001 - TDMA Group Voice Channel Assignment
   00010 - Group Data Channel Assignment
   000ll - Digital Group Voice Channel Assignment
   11111 - Use MT-2

   MT-2:
   0000 - Initiate Test Call
   1101 - Serial Number Request

Changed 'VOICE' to 'ACTIVE' when a channel is active and 
added printout to bottom to show which of the above it is.

Moved site_id to error detected FR frames in logic 
Misc other printout tweaks

Reinstated ADD and KICK listings only in analyzer, way too verbose for normal use.

Added pi-build.sh which includes 'cmake .. -DDETACH_KERNEL_DRIVER=ON' line to prevent
need to manually modprobe -r kernel driver prior to using dot-detector and rtl_udp.

V0.26 Build 2020.08.31

Fix LCN channel by acquiring the correct bits; It did work(by fluke), but would have had issues
if the particular site had more than 16 LCN channels

V0.25 Build 2020.08.24
Finally Fixed Site ID to list the correct ID (thanks EricCottrell)
Changed Group ID from 7FFF to FFFF (16 bit GID)
Changed Status to 5-bit MT-1 Status and 4-bit MT-2 Status
MT-1 and MT-2 Binary Print out in Debug 1 and higher
(Also need to work on MT-A/MT-B/MT-D)
Put lshifter back in for ESK EA LCN; need somebody to test LCNs on normal EDACS
Site ID may still be incorrect on non ESK and/or non EA variants
May need to break backwards compatibilty, unsure.

V0.24 Build 2020.08.22
Implemented PEER listing on debug 2 (too verbose to make a normal feature)
Re-wrote sender, group, lcn, and status variables to draw from FR instead of SR
Implemented 'error detection' by comparing fr messages, not full-proof but better
Included 'understanding_frames.txt' file that breaks down FR 40 bit message segments
Minor tweaks to IDLE printing while VOICE still active
Updated Debug to print FR blocks and implemented Debug 3 for 
printing all error checked FR blocks, and Debug 4 for 
non-error checked blocks.

V0.23 Build 2020.08.21
Implemented Human Readable 'FR' blocks of 40 bit (10 HEX) code to 
represent the 40 bit segments of 'messages' the control channel
sends in pairs of threes. Will use this to impliment error checking
in future updates.

Found method to pipe signal from GQRX over UDP into analyzer with nc and sox.
Added gqrx_udp_signal.sh as an example file/usable script.
May add more info on its use in future updates.

Updated to only print AFS info when set to legacy EDACS argument on startup.
(Probably isn't reliable anyways unless its a 4-4-3 AFS bit setup)

V0.22 Build 2020.08.17
Minor code cleaning and tweaking
Cleaned up Debug and simplified
Debug 0 = No verbosity
Debug 1 = SR output for Idle and Voice and legacy AFS info
Debug 2 = Display all commands received, status, and SR, plus debug 1
(Update: SR has been replaced with more human readable FR)
Tinkering with .detector script sample output sound rate (boosted to 48000 mono out)

V0.21 Build 2020.08.15
Fix bug in ledacs-esk-analyzer that didn't show calls placed due to removal of LCNs
Implemented lshifter as an internal variable that changes based on which EDACS system is specified.

v0.2 Build 2020.08.12

Implimented allow/deny lists for groups and senders
Cleaned up or removed lots of code and comments
Removed all code related to PATCH, ID, DATA, and other commands as they were too complex
Removed distinction between a normal call and a PVT call, since it didn't seem reliable
Renamed standalone.sh to analyzer.sh, so I could call ./start.sh with tabs faster
Renamed ledacs-esk-standalone to ledacs-esk-analyzer for consistency
Other minor tweaks/fixes 
Inadvertent new bugs probably


Known Issues:

1.) Site ID, LCN, Group, Sender, or other values may temporarily report an incorrect number.

This issue is primarily due to a lack of any real error detection, if the signal or samples read in that 
exact moment by the software are 'off', then incorect values may temporarily show up.  Due to the simplicity
of this software, this issue will most likely not be fixed, but shouldn't greatly affect the performance
of the software. For now, best fix may be to ensure good signal with your dongle, adjust position/antenna
if its convenient.

Update: Since implementing FR blocks and error detection, this seems to behave much better, but 
may still occur just not nearly as frequently as it used to. True way to fix this would probably
be to implement a second register and compare them, but this could potentially cause bad performance.
Most likely better to sacrifice accuracy for maintaining performance.

2.) Voice channels may open for groups/senders in the deny list

This is due to two factors, the first, as above, iccorect values streaming into the software, it may open
the channel for a bogus group or sender if it didn't read it correctly. Second, the manner of checkdown
that occurs checking the current group versus the deny list, it may open up if the group or sender is
further down the list. A 'quick fix' was implimented to set the squelch high to close the channel, but
this may introduce new issues such as closing a desired voice channel when the denied group/sender
attempts to speak up at the same time.

3.) Allow List overrides Deny list

If you have items in the allow list and the deny list, the deny list will be ignored in favor of the
allow list. This is by design, Allow list only allows what you manually specify, denying everything
else. 

4.) Segmentation fault if incorrect variables are given at command prompt or in start.sh, standalone.sh.

I haven't had time to rewrite the arguments portion of the software, partially out of not wanting to 
break more stuff and end up banging my head against my desk trying to figure it out. Been focused more
on getting what works to work better and stripping out things that don't work so well. Also, I'm not
a good programmer, laziness, busy, etc. etc. Just be sure to use all the required arguments for now. 

5.) Unknown functionality with other variants of EDACS

Currently, this software has only been tested against a few EDACS ESK control channels, since
I don't have any other EDACS in my home area, I have yet to be able to test it against the
original and other variants of EDACS. Any feedback would be appreciated. If nothing happens
for you and you are sure you are tuned to a EDACS CC, then please run debug options on for verbose
details and feel free to submit them. 

rtl_fm -d 0 -f 851375000 -s 28.8k -p 0.5 -g 49 | ./ledacs-esk site243 1 1 3 allow deny >> debug.txt

Run something similar to above for a few moments and then ctrl-c to close it, then submit the 
debug.txt file with a description of the type of EDACS system, any known site ID, etc.

6.) Incorrect Site ID.
Testing has shown that the Site ID is most likely not pulling from the correct portion
of the control channel signal, will need more testing. The location of the Site ID seems
to vary from one CC to another, will need more research.

Update: Still trying to figure this out after implementing FR blocks. So far, I can't find
a reliable pattern to pull site info from. My working hypothesis is that its obscurred or
has multiple rules in play for solving it.

Update Update: Finally figured this out thanks to some seriously awesome help from
EricCottrell at the Radio Reference forums. He had some notes that seriously put
that to bed.
